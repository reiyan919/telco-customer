Telco Customer Churn — Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistical Testing
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset, a real-world business dataset describing customer demographics, service subscriptions, billing behavior, and churn outcomes. The objective is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical hypothesis testing to uncover meaningful patterns related to pricing, contract structure, and customer retention.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, originally provided by IBM Analytics:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

It contains 7,043 customer records and 21 variables, including:

Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, dependents)

Service subscriptions (internet, phone, add-ons)

Contract and payment information

Billing variables (MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)

Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)

Several service-related variables include a third category, “No internet service”, indicating customers without internet subscriptions. This category was retained as a distinct group to preserve meaningful behavioral differences.
